(Pro Fortnite gamer)\n\nCan we get a win this weekend?\nTake me to Loot Lake\nLet's change the game mode and we can Disco Dominate\nLet's hop in an ATK\nTake me to the zone\nI'm running kind of low on mats, I need to break some stone\nDressed in all his fancy clothes\nHe's got Renegade Raider and he's probably a pro\nHe just shot my back\nI turn back and I attack\nI just got a victory royale\nA victory royale\n\nTake me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today\nYou can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake\nI really love to chug jug with you\nWe can be pro Fortnite gamers"
