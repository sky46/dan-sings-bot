(Pro Fortnite gamer)\n\nCan we get a win this weekend?\nTake me to Loot Lake\nLet's change the game mode and we can Disco Dominate\nLet's hop in an ATK\nTake me to the zone\nI'm running kind of low on mats, I need to break some stone\nDressed in all his fancy clothes\nHe's got Renegade Raider and he's probably a pro\nHe just shot my back\nI turn back and I attack\nI just got a victory royale\nA victory royale\n\nTake me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today\nYou can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake\nI really love to chug jug with you\nWe can be pro Fortnite gamers"

What is the takeaway?\nDon't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway\nAnd the tapestry here in my skin\nIs a map of the victories I win\nLook where I've been, I make everything happen\nLook at that mean mini Maui just tippity tapping\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey\n\nWell anyway, let me say \"you're welcome\"\nFor the wonderful world you know\nHey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome\nWell, come to think of it, I gotta go\nHey, it's your day to say \"you're welcome\"\n'Cause I'm gonna need that boat\nI'm sailing away, away, you're welcome\n'Cause Maui can do everything but float\nYou're welcome\nYou're welcome\n\nAnd thank you!"

      "lyrics": "I don't want a lot for Christmas\nThere is just one thing I need\nI don't care about the presents\nUnderneath the Christmas tree\n\nI just want you for my own\nMore than you could ever know\nMake my wish come true\nAll I want for Christmas is you, yeah\n\nI don't want a lot for Christmas\nThere is just one thing I need\nAnd I don't care about the presents\nUnderneath the Christmas tree\n\nI don't need to hang my stocking\nThere upon the fireplace\nSanta Claus won't make me happy\nWith a toy on Christmas Day\n\nI just want you for my own\nMore than you could ever know\nMake my wish come true\nAll I want for Christmas is you\nYou, baby\n\nOh, I won't ask for much this Christmas\nI won't even wish for snow\nAnd I'm just gonna keep on waiting\nUnderneath the mistletoe\n\nI won't make a list and send it\nTo the North Pole for Saint Nick\nI won't even stay awake to\nHear those magic reindeer click\n\n'Cause I just want you here tonight\nHolding on to me so tight\nWhat more can I do?\nBaby, all I want for Christmas is you\nYou, baby\n\nOh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere\nAnd the sound of children's laughter fills the air\n\nAnd everyone is singing\nI hear those sleigh bells ringing\nSanta, won't you bring me the one I really need?\nWon't you please bring my baby to me?\n\nOh, I don't want a lot for Christmas\nThis is all I'm asking for\nI just wanna see my baby\nStanding right outside my door\n\nOh, I just want you for my own\nMore than you could ever know\nMake my wish come true\nBaby, all I want for Christmas is you\nYou, baby"
